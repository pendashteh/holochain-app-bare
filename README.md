# holochain-example-bare
This project contains the least minimum codebase and configuration required to have a valid Holochain app.

# Usecases
1. Starting from the scratch without any presumption about the application
2. Testing build and CI/DC tools
3. Testing the Holochain software itself for the core contributors
